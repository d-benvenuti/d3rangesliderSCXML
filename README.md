# d3rangesliderSCXML

Simple experiment.

# Test

Launch a local web server, e.g.:
`python -m http.server`

then open the web page: localhost:8000/rangeslider.html

Open the console and see the state transitions as they happen.

# Issues

-	After reaching MAX or MIN really fast, the handle does not return to the normal hovering behaviour until it is not dragged again.
-	The hovering of the bar is not yet implemented.
