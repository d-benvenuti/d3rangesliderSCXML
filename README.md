# d3rangesliderSCXML

Simple experiment.

# Test

Launch a local web server, e.g.:
`python -m http.server`

then open the web page: localhost:8000/rangeslider.html

Open the console and see the state transitions as they happen.

# Issues

-	The selection is not yet draggable.
-	The hovering of the bar is not yet working. The DOM elements related to the bar have been found, but "mouseenter" does not work on them.
